  <h3>Will you go Intel or AMD? Let's find out!</h3>
  <p>First you need to know what a CPU is and why its needed in a pc. A cpu also known as central processing unit is the brain of your pc. Two biggest manufacturer making those brain for your pc are Intel and AMD. But what is the difference between Intel and AMD you might ask. Well there are quite a few difference from pure proformance to how they are built. Now if you want a easy and overall cpu for your price we reccomend going with AMD cpu's because AMD CPU's have a quite a pleasent price and almost all AMD cpu's have AM4 socets it will come in handy if you ever want to upgrade your cpu you mostly likely won't have to upgrade your motherboard for the AMD cpu to support it. If you want serious gaming power or one of the fastest cpu we recommend going with Intel but be careful they are power hungry CPU's and run HOT!</p>

  <h3> Now lets talk GPU!</h3>
  <p>Just like CPU you need a GPU also knows as Graphics Processing Unit or a Graphics card. It's job is to render the game and make it run smootly. Also there are 2 kinds of GPU one that are called GTX and others are the more expensive, fancier, and newer called RTX from nVidia while AMD has their own GPU's that go head to head with nVidia's RTX and GTX GPU's we recommend going with a GPU from nVidia.</p></section>

  <h4>*Note- GPU's from Asus, Msi, Gigabyte all use both GPU from nVidia and AMD with minor tweaks. Except EVGA as they are nVidia-specific GPU and Sapphire being AMD-specific GPU. After you're done picking out your CPU's and GPU's head over to the <a href="https://codepen.io/luaapitest/pen/OJOXpJw">Page-4 (How To Stage)</a> for help on building/assambling your PC. </h4>
