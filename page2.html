    <h2>Which components will you pick? Will you go with Intel or AMD? Let's find out!</h2>
    <section>
      <p>First, you need to know what a CPU is and why it's needed in a pc. A CPU also known as the central processing unit is the brain of your pc. The two biggest manufacturers making those brains for your pc are Intel and AMD. But what is the
        differences
        between Intel and AMD? You might ask well there are quite a few difference from pure performance to how they are built. Now if you want an easy and overall CPU for your price we recommend going with AMD CPUs because AMD CPUs have quite a
        pleasent price and almost all AMD CPUs have AM4 sockets it will come in handy if you ever want to upgrade your CPU, you most likely won't have to upgrade your motherboard for the AMD CPU to support it. If you want serious gaming power or
        one of the fastest CPU we recommend going with Intel but be careful they are power-hungry CPUs and run HOT!</p>

      <h3> Now let's talk GPU!</h3>
      <p>Just like a CPU, you need a GPU also known as Graphics Processing Unit or a Graphics card. Its job is to render the game and make it run smoothly. Also, there are 2 kinds of GPU one that is called GTX and the others are the more expensive,
        fancier,
        and newer called RTX from Nvidia while AMD has their GPUs that go head to head with Nvidia's RTX and GTX GPUs we recommend going with a GPU from Nvidia.</p>

      <h4>*Note- GPUs from Asus, Msi, and Gigabyte all use both GPU from Nvidia and AMD with minor tweaks. Except for EVGA as they are Nvidia-specific GPU and Sapphire is AMD-specific GPU. After you're done picking out your CPUs and GPUs head over to
