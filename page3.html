    <h2>Now that you picked out your CPU and GPU you will need a few more things before we get to building your gaming rig!</h2>
    <section>
      <p> To begin with, you will need a good ATX form factor motherboard that supports your CPU and the RAM you picked we recommend going with <strong>Two</strong> 8 gigs sticks of DDR4 or DDR5 memory (RAM - Random Access Memory) making a 16 gigs
        with 3200mhz or higher memory for your PC.
      </p>
      <h3>Here are some of our favorite motherboard and RAM sticks</h3>
      <!-- Will be in "aside" right next to this text -->
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>You will also need storage (SSD and/or HDD) we recommend going with SSD since it's significantly faster than HDD and we recommend getting at least 1 gig or more of M.2 PCI4 or later storage stick. Lastly, you will need a few more simple
        things
        like
        a good mid-tower case that fits the GPU you picked earlier and that has good airflow, you will also need a power supply unit that has enough watts to power your gaming rig we recommend getting an 80+ Gold and a full modular for easier
        upgrades
        later on,
        a
        a couple of fans to keep your PC cooled we recommend also getting an AIO liquid
        cooler for high-end CPUs or a Noctua NH-D15 for a good air cooler and most importantly an Operating system (a version of Windows) and gaming peripherals.</p>
      <h3>For a easy pick on those stuff head over to our gaming peripherals/parts page <a href="page4">here</a>.</h3>
