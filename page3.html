    <h2>Now that you picked out your CPU and GPU you will need few more thing before we get to building!</h2>
    <section>
      <p> To begin with you will need a good motherboard that supports your CPU and the RAM you picked we recommend going with <strong>Two</strong> 8 gigs sticks of DDR4 or DDR5 memory (RAM) making a 16 gigs memory for your PC.</p>
      <h3>Here are some of our favorite motherboard and RAM sticks</h3>
      <!-- Will be in "aside" right next to this text -->
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>You will also need storage (SSD and/or HDD) we recommend going with SSD since it significantly faster than HDD and we recommend getting atleast 1 gig or more of M.2 PCI4 or later storage stick. Lastely you will need few more simple things like a
        good case that fits the GPU you picked earlier and that has good air flow, you will also need a power supply unit that has enough watt to power your gaming rig we reccomend getting a 80+ Gold and a full modular for easier upgrades later on, a couple of fans to keep your PC cooled we recommend also getting a AIO liquid
        cooler for high end CPU's or a Noctua NH-D15 for a good air cooler and most importantly an Operating system (a version of Windows) and gaming peripherals.</p>
      <h3>For a easy pick on those stuff head over to our gaming peripherals/parts page.</h3>
